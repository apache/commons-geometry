/** This class represents an oriented line in the 2D plane.

 * <p>An oriented line can be defined either by extending a line
 * segment between two points past these points, by specifying a
 * point and a direction, or by specifying a point and an angle
 * relative to the x-axis.</p>

 * <p>Since the line oriented, the two half planes on its sides are
 * unambiguously identified as the left half plane and the right half
 * plane. This can be used to identify the interior and the exterior
 * in a simple way when a line is used to define a portion of a polygon
 * boundary.</p>

 * <p>A line can also be used to completely define a reference frame
 * in the plane. It is sufficient to select one specific point in the
 * line (the orthogonal projection of the original reference frame on
 * the line) and to use the unit vector in the line direction (see
 * {@link #getDirection()} and the orthogonal vector oriented from the
 * left half plane to the right half plane (see {@link #getOffsetDirection()}.
 * We define two coordinates by the process, the <em>abscissa</em> along
 * the line, and the <em>offset</em> across the line. All points of the
 * plane are uniquely identified by these two coordinates. The line is
 * the set of points at zero offset, the left half plane is the set of
 * points with negative offsets and the right half plane is the set of
 * points with positive offsets.</p>
