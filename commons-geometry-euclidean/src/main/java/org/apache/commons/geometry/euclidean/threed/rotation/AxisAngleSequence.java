/** <p>
 * Class representing a sequence of axis-angle rotations. These types of
 * rotations are commonly called <em>Euler angles</em>, <em>Tait-Bryan angles</em>,
 * or <em>Cardan angles</em> depending on the properties of the rotation sequence and
 * the particular use case. A sequence of three rotations around at least two different
 * axes is sufficient to represent any rotation or orientation in 3 dimensional space.
 * However, in order to unambiguously represent the rotation, the following information
 * must be provided along with the rotation angles:
 * <ul>
 *      <li><strong>Axis sequence</strong> - The axes that the rotation angles are associated with and
 *      in what order they occur.
 *      </li>
 *      <li><strong>Reference frame</strong> - The reference frame used to define the position of the rotation
 *      axes. This can either be <em>relative (intrinsic)</em> or <em>absolute (extrinsic)</em>. A relative
 *      reference frame defines the rotation axes from the point of view of the "thing" being rotated.
 *      Thus, each rotation after the first occurs around an axis that very well may have been
 *      moved from its original position by a previous rotation. A good example of this is an
 *      airplane: the pilot steps through a sequence of rotations, each time moving the airplane
 *      around its own up/down, left/right, and front/back axes, regardless of how the airplane
 *      is oriented at the time. In contrast, an absolute reference frame is fixed and does not
 *      move with each rotation.
 *      </li>
 *      <li><strong>Rotation direction</strong> - This defines the rotation direction that angles are measured in.
 *      This library uses <em>right-handed rotations</em> exclusively. This means that the direction of rotation
 *      around an axis is the same as the curl of one's fingers when the right hand is placed on the axis
 *      with the thumb pointing in the axis direction.
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Computations involving multiple rotations are generally very complicated when using axis-angle sequences. Therefore, it is recommended
 * to only use this class to represent angles and orientations when needed in this form, and to use {@link QuaternionRotation}
 * for everything else. Quaternions are much easier to work with and avoid many of the problems of axis-angle sequence representations,
 * such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock">gimbal lock</a>.
