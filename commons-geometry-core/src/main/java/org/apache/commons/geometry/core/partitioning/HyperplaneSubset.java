/** Interface representing a subset of the points lying in a hyperplane. Examples include
 * rays and line segments in Euclidean 2D space and triangular facets in Euclidean 3D space.
 * Hyperplane subsets can have finite or infinite size and can represent contiguous regions
 * of the hyperplane (as in the examples aboves); multiple, disjoint regions; or the
 * {@link Hyperplane#span() entire hyperplane}.
 *
 * <p>This interface is very similar to the {@link org.apache.commons.geometry.core.Region Region}
 * interface but has slightly different semantics. Whereas {@code Region} instances represent sets
 * of points that can expand through all of the dimensions of a space, {@code HyperplaneSubset} instances
 * are constrained to their containing hyperplane and are more accurately defined as {@code Region}s
 * of the {@code n-1} dimension subspace defined by the hyperplane. This makes the methods of this interface
 * have slightly different meanings as compared to their {@code Region} counterparts. For example, consider
 * a triangular facet in Euclidean 3D space. The {@link #getSize()} method of this hyperplane subset does
 * not return the <em>volume</em> of the instance (which would be {@code 0}) as a regular 3D region would, but
 * rather returns the <em>area</em> of the 2D polygon defined by the facet. Similarly, the {@link #classify(Point)}
 * method returns {@link RegionLocation#INSIDE} for points that lie inside of the 2D polygon defined by the
 * facet, instead of the {@link RegionLocation#BOUNDARY} value that would be expected if the facet was considered
 * as a true 3D region with zero thickness.
