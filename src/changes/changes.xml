This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.

To generate the file RELEASE-NOTES.txt from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.
-->

<!-- NOTE:
The description attribute entries below are specially formatted
so as to improve the layout of the generated text release notes.

The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
The Velocity template in src/changes/release-notes.vm has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!
