    <section name="Apache Commons Geometry" href="summary">
      <p>
        Commons Geometry provides types and utilities for geometric processing. Key features include
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for Euclidean space in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions</li>
        <li>Support for spherical space in 1 and 2 dimensions</li>
        <li>Support for geometric elements of infinite size</li>
        <li>Support for boolean operations on regions (union, intersection, difference, xor)</li>
        <li>Single external dependency (<a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-numbers/"
            >commons-numbers</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The code below gives a small sample of the API by computing the intersection of cube with a rotated
        version of itself. See the <a href="userguide/index.html">user guide</a> for more details.
      </p>
<source class="prettyprint">
// construct a precision context to handle floating-point comparisons
DoublePrecisionContext precision = new EpsilonDoublePrecisionContext(1e-6);

// create a binary space partitioning tree representing the unit cube
// centered on the origin
RegionBSPTree3D region = RegionBSPTree3D.from(
        Parallelepiped.axisAligned(Vector3D.of(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5), Vector3D.of(0.5, 0.5, 0.5), precision));

// create a rotated copy of the region
Transform3D rotation = QuaternionRotation.fromAxisAngle(Vector3D.Unit.PLUS_Z, 0.25 * Math.PI);

RegionBSPTree3D copy = region.copy();
copy.transform(rotation);

// compute the intersection of the regions, storing the result back into the caller
// (the result could also have been placed into a third region)
region.intersection(copy);

// compute some properties of the intersection region
double size = region.getSize(); // 0.8284271247461903
Vector3D center = region.getBarycenter(); // (0, 0, 0)
